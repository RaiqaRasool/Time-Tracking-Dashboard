# Time-Tracking-Dashboard
This is a solution to time tracking dashboard challenge from front end mentor solution. 

The challenges were that:
Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

## My process
### I Built it with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
